Note: You don't have to create any new components as they are ready out of the box. Please refer to the components section below to lear about their usage. 

## Test Environment Setup
In the project directory, run the following commands:

```
cd .\adp-ui-coding-test\
npm install
npm start

cd .\sample-api\
npm install
npm start

```
